## Project Ideas
- Recipe App
  - Fullstack app where users can write blogs, view recipes, and upload their own recipes
  - We can implement a few models such as a recommendation system, creating a recipe from images the user uploads, abd allowing the user to ask for a specific recipe (with dietary restrictions for example)

| [Techniques for Recommender Systems](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1085/1/012011)  | this paper addresses the different techniques in use when bulding Recommendation Systems(RS). It includes Collaborative and Content-Based filttereing as well as their advantages and dissadvantages. Addtitinally, the Collaborative filterting can be split into both Memory and Model base. For this project it is presumed that Collaborative filtering would be ideal due to its ubiquitousness, easier implementation and rating being received explicitly from the user as the app will be designed to do. A prefereance between memory and model has not been determined at the tim. |
