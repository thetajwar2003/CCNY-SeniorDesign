## Project Ideas
- Facial Recognition:
  - Create a model that mimics FaceId, correctly identifying users when given a random image
- Recipe App
  - Fullstack app where users can write blogs, view recipes, and upload their own recipes
  - We can implement a few models such as a recommendation system, creating a recipe from images the user uploads, abd allowing the user to ask for a specific recipe (with dietary restrictions for example)
